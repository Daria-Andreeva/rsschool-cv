### About Me

I started my career in STEM being a Reseach Assistant and two years later I become Junior Researcher at World-Class Research Centre for Personalized Medicine at Saint-Petersburg. Despite various scientific biological techniqes I also analyzed data using some bioinformatics tools and prograamin in python and R. I`m interested in Web Development because I faced a great amount of user-unfriendly tools for analyzing biological data, modelling molecular structures and so on. My dream is to work on some biological tool, which will be not only practical and powerful, but also easy to use.

My greatest achievements are three articles in peer-reviewed journals (Q1 and Q2) dedicated my masters work and my current work at neuroscience.

Also I teach practical classes where our students learn the basics of current molecular biology methods. In addition, I tutor students for their own scientific projects, which include scientific supervision, experiment design and writing thesis for student conferences. Through this valuable experience, I learned how to look at things from different perspectives and be quick on my feet, for example, answer unexpected questions or create engaging projects for students.
